# Hotel Booking Analysis Project 🏨📈

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data 📊, analysis 💻, and final presentation 🖼️ for a comprehensive **data-driven analysis of hotel booking patterns, cancellation behaviors, and customer segments**. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights that can help hotel management optimize revenue, reduce cancellation rates, and enhance guest satisfaction across different hotel types (City vs. Resort).

The analysis involves cleaning a large dataset, performing extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and generating strategic recommendations based on the observed trends.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Analyze Booking Patterns:** Identify seasonal and weekly trends 📅, peak periods, and the influence of **lead time** on reservations.
2.  **Understand Cancellation Behavior:** Determine the main factors contributing to high cancellation rates ❌ and suggest preventive strategies.
3.  **Segment Customer Types:** Characterize high-value customer segments (e.g., repeat visitors, transient guests) and their booking value.
4.  **Derive Actionable Recommendations:** Provide strategic recommendations 💡 on pricing, marketing, loyalty programs, and operational efficiency for tangible business impact.

## Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations

The following insights were derived from the analysis, with detailed visuals and explanations available in the accompanying files:

| Category | Key Finding | Strategic Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Demand & Seasonality** | **July & August** are the peak booking months. **Weekend nights** show 35% higher demand. | Implement **Dynamic Pricing** 💰 models to maximize revenue during peak seasonal and weekend periods. |
| **Cancellations** | Guests often cancel after **finding better prices elsewhere**. **Resort Hotels** face higher overall cancellation rates. | Offer **Flexible Cancellation Policies** ✅ to reduce guest anxiety. Implement a competitor rate-matching policy. |
| **Customer Loyalty** | **First-Time Guests** make up ~83% of the base, but **Repeat Visitors** spend 40% more per stay. | Develop a **Robust Loyalty Program** 🌟 with exclusive benefits to convert first-time guests into high-value repeat customers. |
| **Booking Lead Time** | Approximately **68% of all bookings** are made $\ge 30$ days in advance. | Focus marketing efforts on **early-bird packages** 🐦 and securing advance bookings to improve forecasting. |
